## Setup

### Downloads

#### .NET Runtime

You will need the .NET Runtime, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft site: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). My recommendation is that you download the latest (5.0 at the time of this presentation).

If you're on a Mac and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, run the command `brew install --cask dotnet` to download the latest [.NET Runtime](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/dotnet).

#### Visual Studio Code & C# Extension

In order to run these examples you will need the [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well as the Microsoft C# add on called [C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).

### Create your own C# solution named "test"

Issue the console the command `dotnet new` like so:

```bash
dotnet new console -n "test"
```

For more information about the .NET CLI set of commands in: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet).

Each command within the .NET set of commands has its own page. For example the `dotnet new` command is in: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new).
