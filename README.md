# VS Code

In order to run these examples you will need the Visual-Studio-Code editor as well as the Microsoft C# add on called "C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)"

## Create your own C# solution named "test"

You will need the .net runtime, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft site: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download.  My recommendation is that you download the latest.

Issue a console the command "dotnet new" like so:

dotnet new console -n "test"

For more information about the dotnet cli set of commands in: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet

Each command within the dotnet set of commands has its own page.  For example dotnet new command is in: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new
